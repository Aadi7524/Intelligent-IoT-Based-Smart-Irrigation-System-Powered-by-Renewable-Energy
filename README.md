🌱 Intelligent IoT-Based Smart Irrigation System Powered by Renewable Energy

📌 Project Overview

This project is a microcontroller-based smart irrigation system that automates water usage in agriculture by leveraging soil moisture sensors, weather data, and renewable solar energy. The system intelligently supplies water based on real-time soil and environmental data, aiming to reduce water waste and minimize reliance on grid electricity.

⚙️ Key Features

🌿 Soil Moisture Sensing – Automates irrigation to avoid over/under-watering.
☀️ Solar-Powered Operation – Powered by solar panels, with LDR sensor for sun detection and optimal energy capture.
🌦️ Weather-Aware Logic – Uses local weather data to enhance irrigation decisions.
📲 Real-Time Monitoring – Integrated with the Blynk app for live data visualization and remote control.
💧 Water Efficiency – Saves up to 40% water compared to traditional systems.
⚡ Off-Grid Ready – Ideal for rural/remote areas with limited electricity access.
